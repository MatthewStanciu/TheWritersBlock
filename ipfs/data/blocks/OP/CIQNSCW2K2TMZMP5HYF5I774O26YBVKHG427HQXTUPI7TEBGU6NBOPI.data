Other planets, like Uranus, are probably chock full of them. They‚Äôre floating around on some space rocks even right now. As it turns out, us Earthlings might be sitting on top of a motherlode of diamonds ‚Äî one quadrillion tons, actually.<br>Over 100 miles under the Earth‚Äôs surface is a section of geology known as cratonic roots. They sit beneath what geologists call a craton, the oldest, most stable section of rock within a continent. </p>
<p>Some reach deep into the interior of the Earth‚Äîcapable of stretching down as much as 200 miles deep, through the outer crust and into the planet‚Äôs mantle ‚Äîhence the ‚Äúroots‚Äù label.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCratons are intimately associated with the some of the most significant events in Earth history, such as the initiation of plate tectonics and the formation of the continents,‚Äù says Joshua Garber, a postdoc at Penn State University and the lead author of the new study. ‚ÄúThey have been stable since the Archean Eon, at least 2.5 billion years ago, so they‚Äôve had plenty of time for lots of happen to them‚Ä¶they‚Äôve been chemically stewing in that mantle for a long time.‚Äù The findings fold into a larger effort to understand the history and processes in the superficial and deep mantle regions of the earth.</p>
<p>In a new paper published in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems this week, an international team of researchers estimates that about 1 to 2 percent of the Earth‚Äôs cratonic roots are made of diamond. That might seem like a small amount, but that tiny fraction is makes up enough of these massive geological formations to account for a quadrillion tons of diamonds. That‚Äôs the number 1 followed by 15 zeros!<br>The research team wasn‚Äôt looking for shiny gems when it made this discovery. </p>
<p>For years now, scientists have collected an enormous amount of data pertaining to the seismic activity of the Earth. That data can be used to create a sort of 3D dimensional map that outlines what the Earth‚Äôs insides look like.</p>
<p>But not all seismic data adds up equally. Much of it is made using sound wave measurements emanating from the Earth after they are triggered by earthquakes, explosions, and other events. These sound waves (also called shear velocities or frictional velocities) travel at different speeds depending on the type and temperature of the material they‚Äôre moving through, and so they move faster through the roots of ancient cratons since they are colder and less dense than the surrounding mantle rock. But the shear velocities are speeding through craton roots at higher than expected velocities.</p>
