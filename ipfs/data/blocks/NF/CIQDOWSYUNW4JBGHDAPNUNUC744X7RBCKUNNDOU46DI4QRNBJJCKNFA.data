ü	ô	<p><strong>The US Argument:</strong><br>Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple.â€My message is pretty clear, itâ€™s the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, weâ€™re ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,â€ he said.</p>
<p>Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets â€œso we can compete fairlyâ€We share a desire to have a more balanced relationship and the balanced relationship is by us selling more goods [to China],â€he said.</p>
<p><strong>Tarrif War: How Did it Start?</strong><br>Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out.</p>
<p>Tackling what he has called â€œunfair trading practicesâ€ has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets. The EU labeled US tariffs a dangerous game!</p>
